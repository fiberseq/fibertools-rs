# From Cargo [![crates.io version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fibertools-rs)](https://crates.io/crates/fibertools-rs)

Installation from `crates.io` requires the rust package manager `cargo`. You can find [how to install `cargo` here.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). Furthermore, a recent version of `gcc` and `cmake` is required. I have tested and recommend `gcc v10.2.0` and `cmake v3.21.1`, though other versions may work.

```
cargo install fibertools-rs
```
