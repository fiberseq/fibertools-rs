# Glossary of Fiber-seq terms

### m6A
**N6-methyladenosine**: A DNA modification made during the Fiber-seq protocol on accessible adenosines. Native m6A sites are exceedingly rare or non-existent in eukaryotic DNA.

### MSP
**Methyltransferase sensitive patch**: A stretch of a Fiber-seq read that has a high density of m6A sites. Specifically it is defined as a region that is inferred to be not occluded by a nucleosome. 

### Nucleosome 


### FIREs
**Fiber-seq Inferred Regulatory Elements**: MSPs that are inferred to be regulatory elements based on features of the MSP including m6A density.
