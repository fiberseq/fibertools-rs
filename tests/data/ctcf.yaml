# Example modules of CTCF footprinting
# Will report using a bit flag if the module does not contain an m6A (is footprinted, 1) or does contain an m6A (is not footprinted, 0) for each module.
# modules must start at zero, be sorted, and be contiguous with one another. At most 8 modules are allowed (8 bit flag).
# intervals are 0-based, half-open (like BED)
## CTCF modules
modules:
  - [0, 1] # extra 1bp
  - [1, 9] # mod 1a
  - [9, 17] # mod 1b
  - [17, 24] # mod 2
  - [24, 30] # mod 3
  - [30, 35] # mod 4
