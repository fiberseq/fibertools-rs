# Example modules of CTCF footprinting
# Will report using a bit flag if the module does not contain an m6A (is footprinted, 1) or does contain an m6A (is not footprinted, 0) for each module.
# modules must start at zero, be sorted, and be contiguous with one another. At most 8 modules are allowed (8 bit flag).
# intervals are 0-based, half-open (like BED)
modules:
  - [0, 8]
  - [8, 16]
  - [16, 23]
  - [23, 29]
  - [29, 35]
