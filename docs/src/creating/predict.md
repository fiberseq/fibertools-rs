# `ft predict-m6a`

This command predicts m6A sites from PacBio Fiber-seq data. The input is a PacBio HiFi BAM file with kinetics and the output is a BAM file with the predicted m6A sites encoded in the ML and MM tags.

Details on the algorithm for m6A prediction are described in this publication: [https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.279095.124](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.279095.124).
