# `ft-extract`

Extract Fiber-seq data into plain text files

## Inputs and options

See the [help message](./ft-extract-help.md) for details.

## Output description

All outputs to `ft extract` can be (and should be) compressed by simply adding the `.gz` extension.
For example, `ft extract input.bam --m6a m6a.bed.gz` will output a compressed bed12 file.

### Shared Output columns:

| Column | Description                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ct     | Chromosome or contig                            |
| st     | Start position of the read on the chromosome    |
| en     | End position of the read on the chromosome      |
| fiber  | The fiber/read name                             |
| score  | The number of ccs passes for the read (rounded) |

### Columns specific to the `--m6a`, `--cpg`, `--nuc`, and `--msp` outputs

All of these files are written in standard bed12 format. The first and last block in each the bed12 record do not reflect real data, and exist only to mark the start and end positions of the read.

| Column      | Description                                                                              |
